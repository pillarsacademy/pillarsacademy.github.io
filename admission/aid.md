# Financial Aid

At Pillars Academy we believe it is our responsibility to make sure the higher standard of education we have set forth is within reach for all families. *Please note that only families K-3 are eligible for financial aid.*

To ensure an impartial and confidential screening process, we have teamed up with Financial Aid for Student Tutition (FAST). For a minimal fee of $41, FAST will collect the required information and prompt you for any supplemental documents.

[To apply, log into our schoolâ€™s page and create an account.](https://www.ismfast.com/V3/FastPage.php?id=21fd3aea06d6887cf80bf1704fa92888)

Upon completion, FAST will present your application to our Financial Aid Committee. The Committee will then determine final eligibility based on the extent of your need and the availability of funds.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please call our Office Manager at (949) 951-0442 or email <enrollment@pillarsacademy.org>.
