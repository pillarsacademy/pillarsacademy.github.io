<b>PASS (Pillars After School Supplements) Community After School Program</b>
We're approaching the end of our third trimester of PASS with friendships formed, and a lot of learning and fun accomplished! Please take this brief survey to help us create the schedule for next year's PASS tailored to YOUR needs! 
</center></b>

As of now, our PASS program runs parallel to the local public school districts' calendars, and does not continue through the summer because we have Summer Camp for all ages! Even teens 14-18 are engaged with our Counselor in Training program!

Summer Camp is available for all ages and runs from 9:30am-2:30pm with After Care from 2:30pm-5:30pm (as well as before care). It's a lot of fun and creatively stimulates them both intellectually and physically, just like we do at PASS! It includes a field trip every week. 

Come back to this page in June for the PASS 2016-17 Fall schedule!!

<b>Pillars Academy now offers it's services and expert teachers to the community via an After School Program including:
Academic Enrichment, Professional Tutoring & Homework Help, Arabic, Qur'an, fun Islamic Studies classes, and professional Sports Trainings like Girls Volleyball, Girls & Boys Basketball, and Girls & Boys Soccer!</b>

The Program is called PASS (Pillars After School Supplementals) and is offered Monday through Friday 3:30pm-5:30pm for all grades Elementary-High School: K-2nd, 3rd-6th, 7th-12th.
