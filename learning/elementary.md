# Elementary K-5

God consciousness, the pursuit and love of knowledge, and service to man are used as cornerstones to drive our curriculum. Pillars Academy's elementary program is driven by the holistic approach to education in which we address the spiritual, academic, social, and emotional needs of a child.

#### California Standards

Aligning to the State of Californiaâ€™s Common Core Standards, our elementary academic curriculum provides young learners with a solid educational foundation in English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Physical education, visual and performing arts are also important aspects of our program and are integrated in the weekly curriculum.

#### Technology

Pillars students begin using technology in Pre-School in order to ultimately compete in the growing global community. The use of technology across the curriculum enhances students' learning and keeps them connected.

#### Religious Studies

Our religious studies program includes the memorization and understanding of the Quran, Islamic studies, and Arabic language classes.

#### Positive Discipline

Through implementation of a management system known as "Positive Discipline", students acquire skills to solve problems by using the Islamic concept of "shura" or consensus building.
