# Preschool

Pillars Academy's preschool program is designed to enhance children’s growth in academics, as well as nurture their social, emotional, physical, spiritual, and creative development so that they make a smooth and successful transition into kindergarten. Our teachers encourage preschool and pre-kindergarten children to be independent and confident individuals, with students learning early on that in order to be successful they need to be responsible. Small and large group activities instill a sense of community and belonging.

#### Preschool Curriculum

Preschoolers are introduced to the English alphabet and numerals with learning encouraged through fun and exciting daily activities. They express their creativity and develop small muscle skills by writing, drawing, painting, coloring and arts and crafts projects; they expand large muscle skills by playing outdoors, skipping, running, hopping, and using tricycles. Social awareness is encouraged by allowing them to act out roles using their imagination in dramatic play. Each child is encouraged to try new activities and experiment freely in a risk-free environment.

#### Pre-Kindergarten Curriculum

Pre-kindergartners are immersed in a more academically challenging environment. Our program is composed of several developmental areas including language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, safety and health, Islamic studies, Arabic, as well as social/emotional, cognitive and physical development. Children are encouraged to express their creativity by exploring teacher directed and child initiated activities. These activities stimulate and challenge their learning and give them the opportunity to grow in a well-balanced academic and developmental curriculum.

#### Technology

Pre-kindergarteners are introduced to technology and curriculum content through interactive media by attending computer lab twice a week to aide in learning and retention. Preschoolers enjoy the use of a computer within their classroom.


#### Quran & Arabic Studies

Memorization of the Quran and incorporating the presence of our creator in daily lessons allows preschool and pre-kindergarten students to become God conscious individuals. Students are also taught the Arabic alphabet, numerals and basic conversational phrases and words. The Arabic language is encouraged throughout the day during indoor and outdoor activities.
