# Leadership

Students are encouraged to lead by example and to continuously strive to improve themselves, their families, their communities, and their environment. To that end, our school wide "six week" themes include Islamic leadership traits which are developed throughout the day by secular as well as Islamic subject teachers. The Islamic leadership traits, such as commitment, responsibility, honesty, respect, are embedded in all student activities and within the positive discipline and Caught Ya! incentive system. Every Pillars Academy student has potential to lead and all students are given opportunities to maximize this potential. Students take on leadership roles within groups in their classrooms and as representatives of their class for school wide function in service learning initiatives.

At Pillars Academy, every child is encouraged to set career goals through exposure to highly accomplished Muslim American men and women. 
Caring for and appreciating our precious Earth and its inhabitants is an essential responsibility of all Muslims. Students practice social and environmental consciousness regularly.
