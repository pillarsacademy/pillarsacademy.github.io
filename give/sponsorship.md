<b>What it means to be a Sponsoring Partner in Compassion</b>

The only way we can lead **positive change** is through **education**, and that education begins with children. Pillars Academy is a **non-profit school** committed to nurturing students to **model compassion** in school, at home, and within the community. **Conflict resolution skills, empathy and understanding** are the center of our students' learning. We believe that we can **improve the world** by raising generations of **socially responsible** and compassionate people. We believe we can shape and **shift back** the **true meaning** and understanding of Islam by **leading compassion** through **human interaction, self-accountability**, and ultimately **open-mindedness**.

If you identify with our endeavors for leading compassion, please [contact us](mona.ebrahim@pillarsacademy.org) about your tax-deductible Sponsorship Selection today!
