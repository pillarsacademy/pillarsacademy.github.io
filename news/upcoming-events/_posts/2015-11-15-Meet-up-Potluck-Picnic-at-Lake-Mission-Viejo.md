11/15 Pillarsâ€™ Monthly Family MEET-UP@ Mission Viejo Lake (Potluck) 11am-3pm
PTC reserved the North Beach at Mission Viejo Lake for our next meet-up! You can invite family and friends; please note that It costs $2 per person, and that You must write down the names of everyone in your party who is coming- no matter what age- up at the front office so that PTC can coordinate enough lake members (The lake requires a Mission Lake Member sign up each group of 15 people attending). IF YOU ARE A MISSION LAKE MEMBER, please let front office know!
