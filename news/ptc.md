The Parent Teacher Council (PTC) is a volunteer arm of Pillars Academy established to support the school’s goals and create an environment that will be nurturing and uplifting for all.

###Purpose

####The purpose of the Pillars Academy PTC is to:
1. Support the mission, vision, and philosophy of the school  
2. Promote a sense of community among parents and the school  
3. Provide financial support for school needs and activities  
4. Create opportunities for parent involvement in the school  
5. Create activities that will allow for school fundraising  
6. Provide for Eid functions and sub-committees

####What is PTC?

Our Parent-Teacher Council consists of individuals working together to support and enrich Pillars Academy. The PTC supports school staff, promotes student self-esteem, and solves school needs through volunteering and funding.

Room parents working together with our staff, conduct monthly meetings to plan valuable family activities and fundraising events. Check out the list of events in the school’s annual calendar. There is always a project underway for you to help with!

Smaller scale PTC activities happen daily at Pillars Academy. Whether it’s volunteering in a classroom or preparing treats for staff appreciation week, we encourage all Pillars Academy parents to participate whenever possible. Attending monthly PTC meetings isn’t a prerequisite!

The heart of the PTC really is this everyday working relationship between parents and staff. The effort put forth on a daily basis at Pillars Academy is extraordinary. On behalf of Pillars Academy, we would like to thank each parent, staff member and volunteer who works so hard all year long to make our school an educationally enriched environment for our kids.

Thank you for your commitment to our students.

Sign up today to be a PTC member. Together we can make a difference!
