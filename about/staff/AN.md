<b>Anna Norris</b>

I have a Clear California Teaching Credential and a Master of Arts in Teaching from the University of California, Irvine. I am currently working on a Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction at Cal State Fullerton. I have had the pleasure of working at Pillars Academy for the past seven years as an elementary teacher. I am an avid reader and I love to share my love of reading and writing with students across the subject areas.
