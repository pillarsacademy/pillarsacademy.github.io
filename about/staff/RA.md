<b>Runa Arghandehwal</b>

I majored in economics and general mathematics, and received my degree in Afghanistan. I love teaching children about Islam and sharing with them all that I know; but most of all, I just love being around chihldren! I have been a teacher for 10 years and have been enjoying every bit of it. I am happy to be a part of Pillars Academy and love to continue being so! I love teaching here because of the islamic values that I can share with my children, and because the Prophet Muhammad was also a teacher also because of the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) being teacher too. I love teaching in general because of the calm and comfortable environment.
