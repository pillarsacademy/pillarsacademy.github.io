<b>Faeiza Hadi</b>
I have taught now for nearly 30 years and approach each year with a fresh start. I truly enjoy providing the Islamic foundation to our future leaders and always love seeing them thrive and develop. 
•	Belief:
I am a teacher who truly believes that every student will strive in the future and their bright minds will enable them to go above and beyond society’s standards. 
•	Dedication:
I do my best to make sure every student has an understanding of my lessons and teachings, and I dedicate extra time to those who do not, so that they would have a promising future.

We will accomplish this through learning, playing, music and other guided learning. I love serving my community by teaching the young and bright children at Pillars. Watching the students grow and develop brings me joy every year. I have students come back and visit me as professionals and even as parents!
