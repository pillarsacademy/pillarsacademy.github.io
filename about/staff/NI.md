<b>Niran Ibrahim</b>
I have a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, and continued my education to recieve my credentials in Early Childhood. I've been at Pillars for more than 9 years working as an after school teacher, Sunday school teacher, Pre-K assistant, and now a Pre-K teacher. I love to see the children grow over the years. It is really rewarding to hear the great stories each child remembers while being part of an Islamic environment and making friends from different backgrounds. I have three children of my own and live in Mission Viejo. Some of my hobbies include swimming and talking walks along the beach. I also enjoy spending lots of time with my family.
