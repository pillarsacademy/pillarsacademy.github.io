<b>Farrah Yasmin</b>

I have been teaching for 20 years in different capacities and this is my first year at Pillars Academy. It’s a great place to work and I’m very excited. Teaching is my passion and I strive to inspire & challenge children to love learning. I believe every child is unique and gifted with special talent. And I want to be an inspiring, motivating, and encouraging part of their journey to success. I live in Foothill Ranch with my husband and two kids; a girl (11) and a boy (9).
