<b>Assil Alsharifi</b>

I’ve been teaching Arabic for eleven years. I started teaching Arabic at Berlitz Language Center, then moved on to teach at Pillars Academy.  I love teaching the Arabic language because it’s the language of the Holy Quran , and as an Arabic teacher my goal is to instill the love of the Arabic language in my students by creating a fun and enjoyable environment in the classroom. 
I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq, have been married for twenty six years, and have four children. I love reading and walking on the beach with my husband.
