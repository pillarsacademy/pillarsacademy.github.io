<b>Bushra Assaf</b>

I have a B.A. in Libraries science, and I have taken my Child Development courses at Saddleback College. I have been working at Pillars Academy since 2013. My passion is teaching and watching children learn and grow. I look forward to getting to know your child, and creating a well-balanced and nurturing classroom where children can feel comfortable to explore and create. Iâ€™m proud to be a part of the Pillars Academy Family. I am married with two great kids.
