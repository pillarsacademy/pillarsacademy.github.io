<b>Amani Chalati</b>

I have almost 14 years of experience as an early childhood educator, working with children between ages 3 years old to age 13 years old. I love teaching because it can make you laugh, even cry, but also make you work harder than you ever thought you could. Some days you're trying to change the world and some days you're just trying to make it through the day. Your heart is full, and your mind packed with memories of kids who have changed your life. Just another day in the classroom.

I also enjoy spending time reading, exercising and spending time with my 15 years old daughter Shaam. I love traveling, learning, and speaking new languages.
