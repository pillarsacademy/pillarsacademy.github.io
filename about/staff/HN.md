<b>Hasina Noorzoy</b>

I have a AA degree in Liberal Studies from Santiago Canyon College and my Bachelors from Cal State Long Beach. 
I am still continuing my education in Human Development In Sha Allah. I had the privilege with working with the children at Pillars Academy last school year and I am excited for the upcoming school year to watch the children develop and grow In Sha Allah. What I enjoy the most at Pillars Academy is the loving and caring atmosphere Ma Sha Allah.
