<b>Megan Elizabeth Webb</b>

I have a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential and a Masters in Education from Pepperdine University. This is my third year at Pillars Academy.  I am so grateful to have the opportunity to teach in such a warm and caring school and look forward learning more about you! As for myself, I enjoy reading, watching cooking shows, and spending time in nature.
