It is with immense excitement that I welcome you with greetings of peace to our website. Pillars Academy is the hidden jewel in Mission Viejo, California that provides Islamic education and core academics within a loving and nurturing environment. As our mission states:

*Pillars Academy is a private Islamic school established by the Orange County Islamic Foundation in 2000, which provides a holistic approach to education. We address the spiritual, academic, social, and emotional needs of a child. Our students belong to a community of faith, including parents and teachers, which strengthens their identity as Muslims. Students are encouraged to be leaders striving to improve themselves, their families, their communities, and their environment.*

The curriculum stresses Ihsan or excellence in Islamic Studies and core subjects which include Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies based on the holistic approach to education. Our students are taught to embody Islam. The Quran is used as a source of divine knowledge that must be read, understood, committed to memory, and most importantly applied to daily life.

Pillars Academy recognizes the unique position our children hold as American Muslims, and our aim is to develop their confidence in order to become leaders of society, who, above all else are God conscious. Again, I welcome you to our website. Browse around and feel free to call us at 949.951.0442 or email us at <info@pillarsacademy.org> in relation to any inquiries you may have.

**Warmest Regards,**  
Zubeda Kazi

Director, Pillars Academy
