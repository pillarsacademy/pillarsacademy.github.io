##More about...

###Faeiza Hadi
I have taught now for nearly 30 years and approach each year with a fresh start. I truly enjoy providing the Islamic foundation to our future leaders and always love seeing them thrive and develop. 
•	Belief:
I am a teacher who truly believes that every student will strive in the future and their bright minds will enable them to go above and beyond society’s standards. 
•	Dedication:
I do my best to make sure every student has an understanding of my lessons and teachings, and I dedicate extra time to those who do not, so that they would have a promising future.

We will accomplish this through learning, playing, music and other guided learning. I love serving my community by teaching the young and bright children at Pillars. Watching the students grow and develop brings me joy every year. I have students come back and visit me as professionals and even as parents! 

###Runa Arghandehwal
I majored in economics and general mathematics, and received my degree in Afghanistan. I love teaching children the information about Islam and general studies that I know, but also love being around children. I have been a teacher for 10 years and have been enjoying every bit of it. I am happy to be a part of Pillars Academy and love to continue being so!

###Sohayla Behzadnia
I am a mother of two girls and two boy. I got my Masters in Education from University of Florida and required Early Childhood Education from Irvine Valley College.

I have worked as a volunteer instructor at different Islamic or educational  centers,  such as ISOC,  OCIF and ECEF, teaching students at levels ranging from Preschool through teen years; I have also been the head of  ECEF Public Relation Committee for more than two decades. I have formally been a Preschool/ Pre K Lead teacher since 2003. 

My hobbies are hiking, gardening, garnishing, reading, arts and craft. My goal is as a facilitator, to provide developmentally appropriate  learning experiences for my students while maintaining a safe, supportive, fun and educational classroom environment. Overall I would like to make a positive difference in my community and " to Be the Change I wish to see in Pillars Academy" Ensha' Allah I will do my best to have a role in making  Pillars yet a better Life Development School to be.

###Amani Chalati 
I have almost 14 years of experience as an early childhood educator working with children age 3 year old to age 13 year old 
I work in USA and aboard I taught all subjects and this add to my experience a great deal
 I also enjoy spending time reading, exercising and spending time with my 15 years old daughter Shaam 
I love traveling, learning and speaking new languages 
I like teaching because you laugh you cry and you work harder than you ever thought you could. Some days you're trying to change the world and some days you're just trying to make it through the day. Your heart is full, and your mind packed with memories of kids who have changed your life. Just another day in the classroom.

### Niran Ibrahim
I have a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering. I continued my education and took Early Childhood classes in order to work in an Islamic school like Pillars Academy. I've been at Pillars for more than 9 years working as an after school teacher, Sunday school teacher, assistant and now a Pre-K teacher. I love to see the children grow over the years. It is really rewarding to hear the great stories each child remembers while being part of an Islamic environment and making friends from different backgrounds. I have three children of my own and live in Mission Viejo. Some of my hobbies include swimming and talking walks along the beach. I also enjoy spending lots of time with my family.

###Hasina Noorzoy 
I am one of the Pre K Teacher's Assistants. I have a AA degree in Liberal Studies from Santiago Canyon College and my Bachelors from Cal State Long Beach. I am still continuing my education in Human Development In Sha Allah. I had the privilege with working with the children at Pillars Academy last school year and I am excited for the upcoming school year to watch the children develop and grow In Sha Allah. What I enjoy the most at Pillars Academy is the loving and caring atmosphere Ma Sha Alllah. 

###Megan Elizabeth Webb and I will be co-teaching Kindergarten and First Grade. I have a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential and a Masters in Education from Pepperdine University. This is my third year at Pillars Academy.  I am so grateful to have the opportunity to teach in such a warm and caring school and look forward learning more about you! As for myself, I enjoy reading, watching cooking shows, and spending time in nature.

###Anna Norris
I have had the pleasure of working at Pillars Academy for the past seven years as an elementary teacher. I have a Clear California Teaching Credential and a Master of Arts in Teaching from the University of California, Irvine. I am currently working on a Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction at Cal State Fullerton. I am an avid reader and I love to share my love of reading and writing with students across the subject areas.

###Farrah Yasmin
I live with my husband and two kids; a girl (11) and a boy (9). I have been teaching for 20 years in different capacities and this is my first year at Pillars Academy. It’s a great place to work and I’m very excited. I’ll be teaching Mathematics and Science to Kindergarten and First grade students. Teaching is my passion and I strive to inspire & challenge children to love learning. I believe every child is unique and gifted with special talent. And I want to be an inspiring, motivating, and encouraging part of their journey to success.
