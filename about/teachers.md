##More about...

###Zubeda Kazi
I have been teaching for fifteen years and have been the Preschool Director for five years at NAEYC accredited Pillars Academy.  I have a Bachelors degree in Early Childhood Education, Certificate of Proficiency in Computer Science, and the Preschool Director Permit from Commission on Teacher Credentialing. 

It is one of my goals to create a community of learners where we encourage children to discover their individuality, while working alongside them to maximize it. I believe in hands-on experiences, learning creatively, and learning though play. I want students of Pillars Academy to be confident and apply what they’ve learned in school to real-life situations and become future successful leaders. 
My hobbies are learning and understanding the Quran by listening and watching lectures by renowned scholars. Spending time with my grandchildren is of course my favorite leisure activity.

###Assil Alsharifi
I’ve been teaching Arabic for eleven years. I started teaching Arabic at Berlitz Language Center, then moved on to teach at Pillars Academy.  I love teaching the Arabic language because it’s the language of the Holy Quran , and as an Arabic teacher my goal is to instill the love of the Arabic language in my students by creating a fun and enjoyable environment in the classroom. 
I was born and raised in Baghdad, Iraq, have been married for twenty six years, and have four children. I love reading and walking on the beach with my husband. 

###Runa Arghandehwal
I majored in economics and general mathematics, and received my degree in Afghanistan. I love teaching children about Islam and sharing with them all that I know; but most of all, I just love being around chihldren! I have been a teacher for 10 years and have been enjoying every bit of it. I am happy to be a part of Pillars Academy and love to continue being so! I love teaching here because of the islamic values that I can share with my children, and because the Prophet Muhammad was also a teacher also because of the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) being teacher too. I love teaching in general because of the calm and comfortable environment.

###Sohayla Behzadnia
My Masters in Education is from the University of Florida and I received my Early Childhood Education from Irvine Valley College.

I have worked as a volunteer instructor at many different Islamic or educational  centers, such as ISOC,  OCIF, and ECEF; teaching students at levels ranging from Preschool through teen years. I have also been the head of the ECEF Public Relation Committee for more than two decades. I have formally been a Preschool/ Pre K Lead teacher since 2003. 

I am a mother of two girls and two boys.  My hobbies are hiking, gardening, garnishing, reading, arts and craft. My goal is to facilitate and provide developmentally appropriate  learning experiences for my students while maintaining a safe, supportive, fun, and educational classroom environment. Overall, I would like to make a positive difference in my community and to "Be the Change I wish to see" in it, by playing a vital role in flourishing Pillars Academy as a Life Development School.

###Amani Chalati 
I have almost 14 years of experience as an early childhood educator, working with children between ages 3 years old to age 13 years old. I love teaching because it can make you laugh, even cry, but also make you work harder than you ever thought you could. Some days you're trying to change the world and some days you're just trying to make it through the day. Your heart is full, and your mind packed with memories of kids who have changed your life. Just another day in the classroom.

I also enjoy spending time reading, exercising and spending time with my 15 years old daughter Shaam. I love traveling, learning, and speaking new languages.

###Faeiza Hadi
I have taught now for nearly 30 years and approach each year with a fresh start. I truly enjoy providing the Islamic foundation to our future leaders and always love seeing them thrive and develop. 
•	Belief:
I am a teacher who truly believes that every student will strive in the future and their bright minds will enable them to go above and beyond society’s standards. 
•	Dedication:
I do my best to make sure every student has an understanding of my lessons and teachings, and I dedicate extra time to those who do not, so that they would have a promising future.

We will accomplish this through learning, playing, music and other guided learning. I love serving my community by teaching the young and bright children at Pillars. Watching the students grow and develop brings me joy every year. I have students come back and visit me as professionals and even as parents! 

### Niran Ibrahim
I have a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering, and continued my education to recieve my credentials in Early Childhood. I've been at Pillars for more than 9 years working as an after school teacher, Sunday school teacher, Pre-K assistant, and now a Pre-K teacher. I love to see the children grow over the years. It is really rewarding to hear the great stories each child remembers while being part of an Islamic environment and making friends from different backgrounds. I have three children of my own and live in Mission Viejo. Some of my hobbies include swimming and talking walks along the beach. I also enjoy spending lots of time with my family.

###Hasina Noorzoy 
I have a AA degree in Liberal Studies from Santiago Canyon College and my Bachelors from Cal State Long Beach. I am still continuing my education in Human Development In Sha Allah. I had the privilege with working with the children at Pillars Academy last school year and I am excited for the upcoming school year to watch the children develop and grow In Sha Allah. What I enjoy the most at Pillars Academy is the loving and caring atmosphere Ma Sha Allah. 

###Anna Norris
I have a Clear California Teaching Credential and a Master of Arts in Teaching from the University of California, Irvine. I am currently working on a Master of Science in Curriculum and Instruction at Cal State Fullerton. I have had the pleasure of working at Pillars Academy for the past seven years as an elementary teacher. I am an avid reader and I love to share my love of reading and writing with students across the subject areas.

###Megan Elizabeth Webb 
I have a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential and a Masters in Education from Pepperdine University. This is my third year at Pillars Academy.  I am so grateful to have the opportunity to teach in such a warm and caring school and look forward learning more about you! As for myself, I enjoy reading, watching cooking shows, and spending time in nature.

###Farrah Yasmin
I have been teaching for 20 years in different capacities and this is my first year at Pillars Academy. It’s a great place to work and I’m very excited. Teaching is my passion and I strive to inspire & challenge children to love learning. I believe every child is unique and gifted with special talent. And I want to be an inspiring, motivating, and encouraging part of their journey to success. I live in Foothill Ranch with my husband and two kids; a girl (11) and a boy (9).
