#### About

Pillars Academy Weekend School is a weekend school in Mission Viejo providing Islamic Education to the children in its surrounding community.

#### Description

Pillars Academy Weekend School provides a premier, motivational Islamic curriculum (Qur’an, Islamic Studies, Arabic) and vibrant activities led by caring teachers. Pillars students develop respect, self-discipline, and confidence. The weekend school reinforces the Islamic identity of our children as contributing leaders of society.

The Weekend School program is an integral part of the Pillars Academy Educational Services and offers our children a truly Islamic learning experience that helps develop their values, beliefs, and practices in accordance with the teachings of the Holy Quran and traditions of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

SCHOOL YEAR:	Sept – June
SCHOOL HOURS:	9:45 am to 2:00 pm every Saturday (Arabic immersion) & Sunday

The ultimate objective of the program is to nurture the ideal American Muslim identity that allows our children to achieve success in this world and the hereafter. With this ideal vision in mind, OCIF has structured the Weekend School Program around the following areas of focus:

Arabic Language: Mastering the alphabet, vowels, and commonly used Islamic words

Holy Quran: Memorization of surahs, learning their meanings and interpretations

Islamic Studies: Elements of Iman (faith); Islamic Morals and Etiquettes; Five Pillars of Islam – Shahadah (oneness of God), Salat (5 Daily Prayers), Saum (Fasting in Ramadan), Zakah (Obligatory Charity), Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca); Sirah (biography) and Hadith (traditions) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), stories of all the prophets mentioned in the Holy Quran (Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa, and others – peace be upon all of them), etc.

The program is administered by a team of well-qualified/experienced teachers and dedicated staff members under the guidance of the Pillars Academy Board Education Committee. The teaching methodology involves use of various techniques such as storytelling, hands-on activities, nasheed singing, and analytical reasoning supplemented through the I LOVE ISLAM series of books published by Islamic Research Foundation to help students truly love Islam, understand and internalize Islamic Studies, and prepare them to live Islam and practice it for life.
